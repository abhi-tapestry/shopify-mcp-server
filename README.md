# Shopify MCP Server for Claude

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Claude and other MCP-compatible AI assistants to interact with your Shopify store data. This integration allows AI assistants to directly access product catalogs, customer information, and order details, providing more accurate and contextual assistance for e-commerce tasks.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher (Python 3.12 recommended)
- A Shopify store with API access credentials (Admin API access)
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop) or any MCP-compatible AI assistant
- Basic understanding of terminal commands

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shopify-mcp-server.git
cd shopify-mcp-server
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate on macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

# Activate on Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install ShopifyAPI python-dotenv
```

### 4. Configure Shopify Credentials

You have two options for configuring your Shopify API credentials:

#### Option A: Using the .env file (quickest setup)

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
SHOPIFY_SHOP_URL=your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SHOPIFY_PASSWORD=your_private_app_password_here
```

Or if using an access token:

```
SHOPIFY_SHOP_URL=your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
```

#### Option B: Using a secure profile (recommended for production)

Run the setup script which will guide you through the process:

```bash
chmod +x setup_credentials.sh
./setup_credentials.sh
```

This creates a secure `~/.shopify_profile` file with restricted permissions.

### 5. Test Your Configuration

Verify your setup by running:

```bash
chmod +x test_env.sh
./test_env.sh
```

This checks if your credentials are properly loaded and accessible.

### 6. Start the Server

Make the server script executable and run it:

```bash
chmod +x shopify_mcp.py
chmod +x run_server.sh
./run_server.sh
```

By default, the server runs on port 8080. To use a different port:

```bash
./run_server.sh --port 8888
```

## üîß Configuring Claude Desktop

To add the Shopify MCP server to Claude Desktop:

1. Open Claude Desktop's configuration file:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   nano ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   
   # Windows
   notepad %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

2. Add the following Shopify configuration to your existing `mcpServers` section:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "shopify": {
         "command": "/Users/your-username/shopify-mcp-server/run_server.sh",
         "workingDir": "/Users/your-username/shopify-mcp-server"
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   Important notes:
   - Replace `/Users/your-username/` with the actual path to your project
   - If you already have other MCP servers configured, just add the "shopify" entry to your existing "mcpServers" object
   - The configuration above assumes you're using the default port (8080)

3. Restart Claude Desktop to apply the changes

4. In the Claude Desktop app, you should now see Shopify tools available for use

## üõ†Ô∏è Available MCP Tools

The server exposes the following MCP tools to Claude:

| Tool Name | Description | Parameters |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `get_product_list` | Retrieves a list of products | `limit`: Maximum number of products (default: 10) |
| `get_customer_list` | Retrieves a list of customers | `limit`: Maximum number of customers (default: 10) |
| `get_order_list` | Retrieves a list of orders | `limit`: Maximum number of orders (default: 10) |
| `search_products` | Searches for products | `query`: Search term for products |
| `get_store_info` | Retrieves store information | None |

## üîç API Endpoints

The server also exposes REST API endpoints that can be accessed directly:

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Parameters |
|----------|--------|-------------|------------|
| `/health` | GET | Health check for the server | None |
| `/api/products` | GET | Get list of products | `limit`: Number of products |
| `/api/customers` | GET | Get list of customers | `limit`: Number of customers |
| `/api/orders` | GET | Get list of orders | `limit`: Number of orders |
| `/api/search` | GET | Search for products | `q`: Search query |
| `/api/store` | GET | Get store information | None |
| `/mcp` | POST | MCP protocol endpoint | JSON body with method and params |

## üîí Security Best Practices

- **Credential Protection**: API credentials are stored with restricted file permissions (600)
- **No Plaintext in Config**: The wrapper script loads credentials at runtime
- **Minimal Access**: Configure your Shopify API access with the least privileges needed
- **Local Only**: By default, the server listens only on localhost for security
- **Regular Rotation**: Periodically rotate your API keys and tokens

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Credentials Not Loading**
   - Verify credentials exist in `.env` or `~/.shopify_profile`
   - Check permissions on profile file: `ls -la ~/.shopify_profile`
   - Run `./test_env.sh` to diagnose credential issues

2. **Connection Errors**
   - Verify your Shopify URL is correct
   - Ensure API keys are valid and have sufficient permissions
   - Check if your IP is allowed in Shopify API settings

3. **Claude Desktop Integration**
   - Ensure the path in `claude_desktop_config.json` is absolute and correct
   - Verify Claude Desktop has been restarted after changes
   - Check that the server scripts are executable

### Debug Mode

To run the server with verbose output:

```bash
DEBUG=1 ./run_server.sh
```

## üß† How Claude Uses This Server

Claude can use this server to:

1. Look up product information when helping customers with product questions
2. Access customer order history to provide personalized recommendations
3. Review inventory levels when discussing product availability
4. Search for products matching specific criteria
5. Get store information for contextual understanding

Example prompt for Claude:

> "Use the Shopify tools to find all products from vendor 'Acme', and then summarize their price range and average inventory level."
