- Basic understanding of terminal commands

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shopify-mcp-server.git
cd shopify-mcp-server
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv-py312

# Activate on macOS/Linux
source .venv-py312/bin/activate

# Activate on Windows
.venv-py312\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install ShopifyAPI fastmcp python-dotenv
```

### 4. Configure Shopify Credentials

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
SHOPIFY_SHOP_URL=your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
```

Or for API key authentication:

```
SHOPIFY_SHOP_URL=your-store.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SHOPIFY_PASSWORD=your_private_app_password_here
```

Alternatively, you can use the setup script for a more secure configuration:

```bash
chmod +x setup_credentials.sh
./setup_credentials.sh
```

### 5. Test Your Configuration

Verify your setup by running:

```bash
chmod +x test_env.sh
./test_env.sh
```

### 6. Make the Server Executable

```bash
chmod +x claude_server.sh
```

## üîß Configuring Claude Desktop

To add the Shopify MCP server to Claude Desktop:

1. Open Claude Desktop and click on the settings icon

2. In the MCP settings section, add a new server with these settings:
   - Name: Shopify Store
   - Command: /full/path/to/shopify-mcp-server/claude_server.sh
   - Working Directory: /full/path/to/shopify-mcp-server

   Make sure to replace `/full/path/to/` with your actual file path.

3. Save the configuration and restart Claude Desktop

4. Claude should now have access to your Shopify store data!

## üß† Using Shopify Tools with Claude

Once configured, you can ask Claude to use the Shopify tools in your conversations. Here are some examples:

- "Show me the top 5 products in my store"
- "Find all customers who have spent more than $100"
- "Search for products made by vendor X"
- "Get details about my recent orders"
- "What's the average price of products in my catalog?"

Claude will access your Shopify data through the MCP server and provide insightful responses based on your actual store information.

## üîí Security Best Practices

- **Credential Protection**: Store API credentials with restricted file permissions (600)
- **Read-Only Access**: The MCP server only retrieves data and cannot modify your store
- **Minimal Access**: Configure your Shopify API access with the least privileges needed
- **Local Only**: The server runs locally on your machine for maximum security
- **Credential Rotation**: Periodically rotate your API keys and tokens

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Shopify MCP server:

1. **Check your credentials**
   - Verify your Shopify API credentials are correct in your `.env` file
   - Make sure your shop URL is properly formatted (e.g., `your-store.myshopify.com`)

2. **Verify Claude Desktop configuration**
   - Ensure paths in the Claude Desktop settings are absolute and correct
   - Check that the working directory is properly set
   - Restart Claude Desktop after making configuration changes

3. **Check server execution**
   - Make sure `claude_server.sh` is executable
   - If you encounter permission issues, run `chmod +x claude_server.sh`

For more detailed setup information, refer to the [CLAUDE_SETUP.md](CLAUDE_SETUP.md) file.
